# Clinic-Management-System

Clinic Management system is a web-based application designed for making tasks convenient in handling problems related to patients, all the specific problems will be solved with the integration of all the tasks that needs to be performed to take care of a patient.

The main problem we have focused was providing a clear path for effective communication between the two parties and to maintain data efficiency, get rid of data redundancy and keep records of the patients.

We have taken all the above into consideration and we have introduced a system to provide comfort to the customer, we have also come up with solutions to make sure the customers will have maximum efficiency in time saving, having a cost-effective mechanism, and to provide the client with urgent care with the best available service.

We have concluded that this system is important in Saving lives of a dozen of patients so therefore we are ready to provide this web app to any veterinary institution who would seek our service in the near future.
